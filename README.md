# **Federated Learning with Blockchain Integration using TensorFlow and Web3**  

This project implements **Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) with blockchain integration** for **secure model update tracking**. The system is designed for **financial data**, where different clients hold **different feature subsets** and collaboratively train a model. Additionally, **updates are stored locally** and optionally submitted to a **blockchain smart contract** for tracking.  

## **Features**  
✅ **Vertical Federated Learning**: Different clients train on different features.  
✅ **Feature Selection**: Uses **SelectKBest** to select the most important features.  
✅ **Blockchain Integration**: Stores model updates on **Ethereum** via **Infura**.  
✅ **Local Model Storage**: Saves model weights locally with versioning.  
✅ **Neural Network with TensorFlow**: Uses **fully connected layers** for predictions.  

## **Installation & Setup**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phantomkali/Fed-learning-with-blockchain.git
cd Fed-learning-with-blockchain
```  

### **2. Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

### **3. Prepare the Configuration File**  
Update the configuration inside `train.py` with your **blockchain details**:  

```python
config = {
    "infura_url": "YOUR_INFURA_URL",
    "contract_address": "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS",
    "private_key": "YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY",
    "abi_file": "PATH_TO_YOUR_ABI.json"
}
```

### **4. Run the Training**  
```bash
python train.py
```  

## **How It Works**  

### **🔹 Data Preprocessing**  
- Converts **missing values** to `0` and **scales features**.  
- Splits the dataset into **two clients** with different feature subsets.  
- Performs **feature selection** using `f_regression` to keep **top K features**.  

### **🔹 Training Process**  
- Each client trains a **separate model** on its own data.  
- Models are updated using the **Adam optimizer**.  
- Updates are stored **locally** and optionally **submitted to the blockchain**.  

### **🔹 Blockchain Integration (Optional)**  
- Model updates are stored with **metadata in a JSON file**.  
- A **smart contract** records each update’s **unique storage identifier**.  
- Uses **web3.py** to interact with **Ethereum**.  

## **Results (Example Output)**  

```bash
Selected features for Price_Client: ['Price', '1h %', '24h %']
Selected features for Market_Client: ['Market Cap', 'Volume (24h)']

Epoch 5, Test Loss: 0.0032
Model update for epoch 10 submitted. Storage ID: model_update_20240129_epoch_10, Tx Hash: 0x123abc...
```

## **Future Improvements**  
🚀 **Homomorphic Encryption** for secure client data processing.  
🚀 **Differential Privacy** to improve security in federated learning.  
🚀 **Smart Contract Enhancements** for tracking model updates more efficiently.  

## **Dependencies**
